		<desc><![CDATA[This project has been asked by HETIC, my school on the 2008/2009 years. We had 2 weeks to find a concept around the "Diner des illustres" thematic, and to realize it. An english translation, word by word, would look like something as "The illustrous diner". We had the idea to let the user make a self-portrait and invite some peoples at his table. <br />His objective is to make the most perfect diner. <br />Date: December 2009]]></desc>
