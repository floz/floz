<about>
	<presentation><![CDATA[I discovered I had a passion for Flash development two years ago. I'm currently at HETIC, a computer sciences school, after graduating with a DUT "Services et Réseaux de Communication" (Services and Communication Networks). These two schools gave me some skills related to the domains of the New Technologies of Information and Communication. <br />Last year, I spent 5 months at Havas Entertainement, a web agency, as a Flash Developer.]]></presentation>
