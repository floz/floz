*****************************************************************************

Flex Viewer 1.0 - What's New - Changes in Build 05.22.09

*****************************************************************************

1. Build with latest ArcGIS API for Flex 1.2 and Flex SDK 3.3
-------------------------------------------------------------
This allows take advantage of new features provided by both ESRI Flex API and
the latest Adobe Flash platform.

2. Add filter panel on LiveLayerWidget
-----------------------------------------
You can filter the layer's data at this panel and the result will be displayed
on the map accordingly. For example, in the out of box widget configuration for
police stations, LiveLayerWidet_Police.xml:

<filterfield>
    <name>ADDRESS</name>
    <alias>ADDRESS (Example: 29TH ST )</alias>
</filterfield>

The <filterfield> specifies that the result can be filtered by the Address attribute
and the display will be using the what specified in the <alias> tag. 

3. Enable proxy
----------------
When trying to access data source where crossdomain.xml is not deployed, a proxy
can be used. To do that:
   (1) use the existing tag <proxyType> in the config.xml to specify what proxy
       proxy to use. Provided are JSP, PHP and ASP proxy programs.
   (2) As an example, a new tag <proxy> is added to the GeoRSSWidget to indicate
       to use proxy to retrieve the feed.

The proxy feature is enabled based on the assumption that users usually don't need
proxy for the base maps, rather, it's the external data sources such as GeoRSS feeds
or third party map services might only be accessed via a proxy. The out-of-box
GeoRSSWidget.xml is an example.
